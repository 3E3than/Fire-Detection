# IgnisAI - Real-Time Wildfire Detection and Notification (Prototype)

IgnisAI is a prototype web app for detecting wildfires in real-time and providing rapid notifications. Initially, the detection is focused on US cities, but the system has been designed to easily expand to cover global regions.

## Problem Statement
In recent years, wildfires have increased in frequency and intensity, posing severe risks to communities, ecosystems, and economies. Rapid detection and immediate notification are critical for evacuation and disaster response efforts. However, current systems often suffer from delayed alerts and limited geographical coverage. 

## Solution and Impact
IgnisAI provides a cutting-edge approach to wildfire detection by combining satellite imagery, machine learning, and real-time notifications to enhance early warning systems. Leveraging Google Earth data and insights from the research paper "Predictive Modeling of Wildfires: A New Dataset and Machine Learning Approach" by Hajar Mousannif and Hassan Al Moatassime, IgnisAI translates advanced data processing techniques into a practical, real-world solution.

By integrating a Random Forest classifier with key environmental indicators such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), LST (Land Surface Temperature), and Burned Area metrics, IgnisAI enhances wildfire prediction accuracy. Unlike traditional alert systems that often rely on delayed or manual reporting, IgnisAI delivers instant notifications, allowing emergency responders and communities to take swift action.

This system is designed for scalability and adaptability, initially focusing on wildfire detection in major US cities, with the long-term vision of expanding globally. The future roadmap includes IoT integrations, SMS notifications, cloud-based infrastructure, and customizable user alerts, ensuring that IgnisAI remains a powerful tool in disaster prevention and response.

## Features
- **Real-Time Wildfire Detection:** Uses a Random Forest classifier to analyze google earth data such as NDVI, LST, and Burned Area.
- **US City Focus (Prototype):** Initially predicts wildfire in major US cities, with scalability for a global deployment.
- **Instant Email Notifications:** Alerts are sent via email upon detecting potential wildfire events.
- **Real-Time Sensor Data:** Integrates various environmental indicators like NDVI, LST, and burned area metrics.
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Utilizes historical wildfire data to train and enhance prediction models.
- **Data Validation and Preprocessing:** Ensures data accuracy through calibration and preprocessing methods.
- **API Endpoints for Integration:** Offers RESTful API endpoints that allow integration with third-party IoT devices and dashboards.
- **Scalability:** Designed with the future expansion in mindâ€”including SMS notifications and guest user dashboards.
- **User Customization:** Future improvements will allow users to customize alert thresholds and notification preferences.
- **Dashboard & Visual Analytics:** Provides a web dashboard for real-time monitoring and statistical analysis, including trends over time.
- **Security Measures:** Implements secure data protocols, ensuring the integrity of the system.
- **Cloud Infrastructure Ready:** Prepares for future migration to cloud infrastructure for increased scalability and reliability.
- **Model Optimization:** Uses GridSearchCV to fine-tune the Random Forest model, ensuring optimized detection accuracy.
- **Error Handling and Failover:** Implements robust error handling and failover systems to ensure continuous operation in critical situations.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** The app collects real-time data from google earth engine, NDVI, LST, and burned area.
2. **Wildfire Prediction:** The backend processes this data using a Random Forest classifier optimized through GridSearchCV.
3. **Notification System:** When a potential wildfire is detected, an immediate email notification is sent. Future builds will include SMS alerts for faster communication.
4. **Data Calibration:** Environmental thresholds and calibration techniques ensure reliable and accurate data before classification.
5. **Alert Subscription:** User can subscribe to alert through webapp br providing email and location.
6. **Dashboard:** Web include interactive dashboard with realtime wildfire data.
### Logging

IgnisAI maintains comprehensive logs to facilitate real-time monitoring and post-event analysis. The logging system includes:

- **Real-Time Event Logging:** Captures wildfire detection events, notifications, and error messages.
- **Structured Format:** Logs are maintained in a structured format for easy parsing and analysis.
- **Configurable Storage:** Supports local file storage with options to integrate with external logging services.
- **Audit Trails:** Provides a detailed record of system operations for security and debugging.
- **Adjustable Verbosity:** Log levels can be configured to suit development and production environments.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework, SQLite
- **AI/ML Model:** Random Forest Classifier for wildfire detection
- **Model Optimization:** GridSearchCV for parameter tuning
- **Notification System:** Django Email system (adding SMS notifications in future releases)
- **Deployment:** Planned integration with cloud services for scalability and reliability.
